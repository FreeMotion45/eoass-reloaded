### eoass

EOASS is short for Emanuel's Online Awesome Streaming Service! It's an application which allows use to stream music online!

There is both, a server and a client.

The server, is well, the server to which the clients connect.
And the client is what you run to listen to music!

I am writing this README in retrospect, about 4 years after I originally made this project.
Time really does fly, let's see if I will read this message again at some point in the future!
